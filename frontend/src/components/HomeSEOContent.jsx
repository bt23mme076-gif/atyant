// HomeSEOContent — crawlable, semantic homepage content for SEO.
//
// The clarity-engine chat fills the first viewport. This section sits below it
// (normal body-flow) so Googlebot indexes real text — H1, how-it-works, FAQ —
// instead of an empty input box. It's the only on-page SEO lever a single-URL
// app has, so the copy targets head terms: career clarity, engineering students,
// internships, placements, career switch, higher studies.
//
// Theme-aware via the app's CSS variables (clean light by default, correct in
// dark). Accent is the brand purple (#7567C9). College-agnostic — no single
// college is favored.

    q: "What is Atyant?",
    a: "Atyant is a career clarity engine for Indian engineering students. You type your exact confusion about internships, placements, higher studies or a career switch, and get a verified answer from a senior who went from your college and branch to the path you want.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is Atyant different from a mentor marketplace or a chatbot?",
    a: "It is neither. Every answer is a verified AnswerCard from a senior with the same college, branch and destination. AI matches your exact question to the person who actually walked that path — not generic advice, not a random listing of mentors.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does it cost?",
    a: "Reading verified answers is free. Optional 1:1 sessions with a matched senior are priced between Rs 49 and Rs 599.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which colleges and branches does Atyant cover?",
    a: "NITs, IITs, IIITs, BITS and Tier-2/3 engineering colleges across India — with seniors from CSE, ECE, Mechanical, Metallurgy, Civil, Chemical and more who moved into software, data, product, core and higher studies.",
  },
