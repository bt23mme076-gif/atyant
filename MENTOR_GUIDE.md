# Mentor Experience Submission Guide

## Purpose
As a mentor on Atyant, you provide **REAL EXPERIENCE**, not generic advice. Your raw input gets transformed into structured Answer Cards that help students solve actual problems.

## Important Principles

### ✅ DO:
- Share your actual experience
- Be specific about what you tried
- Include real mistakes you made
- Give step-by-step instructions
- Mention timelines and outcomes
- Be honest about what didn't work

### ❌ DON'T:
- Give generic advice like "just work hard"
- Say "it depends" without context
- Provide motivational quotes
- Skip over your failures
- Be vague about steps
- Suggest things you haven't tried yourself

## The 7 Fields Explained

### 1. When I was in this situation
**What to write**: Your context when you faced a similar problem

**Example**:
```
I was in my 3rd year of college, trying to land a product management 
internship. I had zero PM experience and was competing with students 
who already had internships at startups.
```

### 2. What I tried first
**What to write**: Your initial approach (even if it failed)

**Example**:
```
I started by mass-applying to 100+ companies on LinkedIn. I used a 
generic resume and cover letter template, just changing the company name.
```

### 3. What failed (be specific)
**What to write**: Clear mistakes and why they didn't work

**Example**:
```
- My resume got 0 responses. It was too generic and didn't show any PM skills.
- I didn't understand what PMs actually do, so my cover letters were useless.
- I wasted 2 weeks applying without getting a single interview.
- The mistake: I focused on quantity (applications) instead of quality (preparation).
```

### 4. What worked
**What to write**: The solution that actually solved the problem

**Example**:
```
I stopped applying and spent 3 weeks doing this instead:
- Built a side project: A browser extension that solved a real problem for students
- Documented my product decisions in a blog post
- Reached out to 10 PMs on LinkedIn with my project, asking for feedback
- Got 3 responses, 2 coffee chats, 1 referral
- Used the project in my resume and got 5 interview calls in 2 weeks
```

### 5. Step-by-step actions
**What to write**: Detailed, replicable steps

**Example**:
```
Step 1: Pick a small problem you personally face (don't overthink it)
  - Spend 1 day identifying 5 problems
  - Choose the simplest one

Step 2: Build the smallest possible solution (1-2 weeks max)
  - Don't make it perfect
  - Focus on one core feature
  - Use no-code tools if needed (Bubble, Webflow, etc.)

Step 3: Document your thinking
  - Write a blog: "How I built [X] - Product decisions explained"
  - Include: Problem, Solution, Why I chose this approach, What I learned

Step 4: Get feedback from real PMs
  - Find 10 PMs on LinkedIn (filter by current company + role)
  - Send personalized message: "Built this, would love your feedback"
  - Don't ask for jobs, just feedback

Step 5: Update resume with project
  - Add project at top of resume
  - Use PM language: "Identified user need, validated solution, shipped MVP"
```

### 6. Timeline / Outcomes
**What to write**: How long it took and what happened

**Example**:
```
Total time: 5 weeks
- Week 1: Identified problem, started building
- Week 2-3: Built and shipped project
- Week 4: Wrote blog post, reached out to PMs
- Week 5: Got 5 interview calls, landed 2 final rounds

Result: Got PM internship at a Series B startup
```

### 7. What I would do differently today
**What to write**: Lessons learned and improvements

**Example**:
```
If I were doing this today, I would:
- Start even smaller - my first project was too complex
- Reach out to PMs BEFORE building to validate the idea
- Create a 1-minute video demo instead of just screenshots
- Network earlier - I wasted time applying blindly
- Document the process in real-time instead of after finishing
```

## Real Examples vs Generic Advice

### ❌ Generic (Don't do this):
```
Situation: I wanted to learn web development
First attempt: I watched some tutorials
What failed: I gave up
What worked: I persisted and learned
Steps: Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, practice daily
Timeline: It took time but I succeeded
```

### ✅ Specific (Do this):
```
Situation: I was a mechanical engineer trying to switch to web development 
with zero coding background. I had 3 months before placement season.

First attempt: I enrolled in a Udemy course "Complete Web Development Bootcamp". 
Spent 2 weeks watching videos, taking notes, feeling productive.

What failed: 
- After 2 weeks, I couldn't build anything without looking at solutions
- The tutorial hell trap: I kept starting new courses instead of building
- I realized watching != learning
- Mistake: No practical application, just passive consumption

What worked:
- Stopped all courses mid-way
- Built 3 projects in 6 weeks using Google + documentation
- Project 1: Personal portfolio (1 week) - learned HTML/CSS basics
- Project 2: To-do app (2 weeks) - learned JavaScript and DOM manipulation  
- Project 3: Weather app with API (3 weeks) - learned async JS and API integration
- Each project was broken, ugly, but MINE

Steps:
Step 1: Pick project idea (not from tutorial, solve YOUR problem)
  - Example: I built a tool to track my job applications

Step 2: Google "how to [specific thing]" for each feature
  - Don't watch full tutorials, find specific solutions
  - Example: "how to connect HTML form to JavaScript"

Step 3: Copy code, break it, fix it, understand it
  - Don't worry about best practices initially
  - Focus on making it work first

Step 4: Deploy publicly (GitHub Pages, Netlify)
  - Forces you to finish
  - Creates portfolio piece

Step 5: Start next project immediately
  - Don't perfect current one
  - Build 3 projects > 1 perfect project

Timeline:
Week 1-2: Wasted on courses
Week 3-4: Built portfolio (lots of frustration, but working)
Week 5-6: To-do app (faster, more confident)
Week 7-9: Weather app (felt like real developer)
Week 10-12: Polished all 3, created GitHub portfolio

Result: Got web dev internship, showcased projects in interview

What I'd do differently:
- Skip courses entirely, start building from Day 1
- Join a Discord/Slack community for debugging help (would've saved 50+ hours)
- Learn Git earlier - I lost code twice due to poor version control
- Build projects that solve real problems, not todo apps (everyone has todo apps)
- Record my debugging process - helps solidify learning
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Being too vague
❌ "I practiced coding daily"
✅ "I solved 2 LeetCode Easy problems every morning for 30 days using the REACTO method"

### Mistake 2: Skipping failures
❌ "I tried X and it worked"
✅ "I tried X, Y, Z. X and Y failed because [reason]. Only Z worked after 3 attempts."

### Mistake 3: No timeline
❌ "Eventually it worked out"
✅ "Took 6 weeks total. First 2 weeks were wasted on wrong approach."

### Mistake 4: Generic steps
❌ "Step 1: Learn the basics, Step 2: Practice, Step 3: Apply"
✅ "Step 1: Solve 20 Array problems on LeetCode Easy (1 week), Step 2: Attempt 1 Medium daily..."

### Mistake 5: Hiding the struggle
❌ "I learned React and got a job"
✅ "I spent 3 weeks confused about hooks, built 5 broken projects, then finally understood..."

## Quality Checklist

Before submitting, ask yourself:

- [ ] Could someone follow these exact steps and get similar results?
- [ ] Did I include at least 2 specific mistakes I made?
- [ ] Are the steps detailed enough? (No "just do X")
- [ ] Did I mention actual timelines?
- [ ] Is this MY experience, not general advice?
- [ ] Would my past self understand this?

## Remember

Your raw experience will be transformed into an Atyant Answer Card with:
- Professional tone
- Structured format
- Actionable steps highlighted
- Mistakes clearly listed
- Timeline expectations set

But the CORE CONTENT comes from you. Be specific. Be real. Be helpful.
